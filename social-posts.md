# Social Media Promotion Posts for Ralph UI

## Option 1: Twitter/X Thread (Match the Example Style)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

Just built Ralph UI to get the most out of autonomous AI development.

(Every day I don't let agents work for 14+ hours unattended, is a day wasted) 🤖

Wanted to share what I've built and see what tools everyone else is using for AI agent orchestration. Here's what 6 months of development got me:

[30-60 second demo video showing:
- Chat to PRD transformation
- Ralph Loop launching
- Real-time agent monitoring
- Multiple agents working in parallel]

**Tweet 2 (The Core - Ralph Wiggum Loop):**

Ralph Wiggum Loop - Autonomous AI Development

- Agents run in continuous loops until all tasks complete
- Progress persists in files + git history (not LLM context)
- When context fills, fresh agents spawn with full memory from git
- 14+ hour autonomous sessions are common
- Zero human intervention needed

Been running this daily for client projects - agents work while I sleep, wake up to features implemented and PRs ready

---

**Tweet 3 (Advanced Chat Requirements):**

Advanced PRD Chat - From Vague Idea to Production Specs

- AI-powered deep questioning uncovers hidden requirements
- Auto-extracts user stories with acceptance criteria
- Transforms conversations into structured PRDs
- PRD workflow with type-specific guidance and slash commands
- Quality scoring catches missing requirements before execution

No more "I'll figure it out later" - the AI won't let you skip edge cases

---

**Tweet 4 (Multi-Agent Support):**

7 AI Agents Supported

- Claude Code (with Z.AI and MiniMax providers)
- Cursor Agent
- OpenCode
- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Qwen Code
- Droid (Factory AI)
- gemini-cli (Google)

Session resumption saves 67-90% on tokens:
- 20 messages: 210 exchanges → 20 exchanges

All agents work identically - just select your preference

---

**Tweet 5 (Git Integration):**

Git-Native Storage & Parallel Worktrees

- Every session, PRD, and chat stored in `.ralph-ui/`
- Commits to git - version control your entire AI workflow
- Auto worktree creation for each agent
- Isolated branches prevent conflicts
- PR auto-generation from agent work
- GitHub issue import as stories

Code review your requirements. Roll back to any version. Your agents, your git, your workflow.

---

**Tweet 6 (Real-Time Monitoring):**

Browser-Based Mission Control

- Monitor agents from anywhere (phone, tablet, laptop)
- Live terminal output via WebSocket with full PTY support
- Real-time status indicators: idle, working, error, done
- Push notifications when tasks complete
- Mobile-responsive design
- Watch your AI fleet work while you grab coffee

Your agents never sleep, and now neither does your monitoring

## Option 3: Reddit/Hacker News Style Post

**Title:**

Built a browser-based mission control for autonomous AI agents - Ralph Wiggum Loop on steroids (Rust + React)

**Body:**

After 6 months of development, I'm excited to share Ralph UI - an open-source browser-based control center for orchestrating autonomous AI coding agents.

**The Motivation**

Everyone is moving fast with AI agents. I wanted to build a tool that lets me get the most out of Claude Code and other agents. (Every day I don't let agents work for 14+ hours unattended, is a day wasted)

**What I Built**

**Ralph Wiggum Loop - Autonomous Development**

The core technique that makes this possible:

- Agents run in continuous loops until tasks complete
- Progress persists in files and git history (not LLM context)
- Fresh agents spawn when context fills, reading full state from git
- 14+ hour autonomous sessions are common
- Zero human intervention required

I've been dogfooding this with client projects - agents work while I sleep, I wake up to features implemented and PRs ready.

**Advanced PRD Chat - Requirements Engineering**

Transform vague ideas into production-ready specs:

- AI-powered deep questioning uncovers hidden requirements
- Auto-extracts user stories with acceptance criteria
- PRD workflow with type-specific guidance (/epic, /story, /task, /critique commands)
- Quality scoring catches gaps before execution

**7 AI Agents Supported**

- Claude Code (Anthropic, Z.AI, MiniMax providers)
- Cursor Agent
- OpenCode
- OpenAI Codex CLI
- Qwen Code
- Droid (Factory AI)
- gemini-cli (Google)

Session resumption provides 67-90% token savings:
- 5 messages: 15 exchanges → 5 exchanges (67% savings)
- 10 messages: 55 exchanges → 10 exchanges (82% savings)
- 20 messages: 210 exchanges → 20 exchanges (90% savings)

**Git-Native Storage**

Every session, PRD, and chat stored in `.ralph-ui/` and committed to git:

- Auto worktree creation for each agent
- Isolated branches prevent conflicts
- PR auto-generation from agent work
- GitHub issue import as stories
- Version control your entire AI workflow

**Real-Time Browser Monitoring**

- Monitor agents from anywhere (phone, tablet, laptop)
- Live terminal output via WebSocket with full PTY support
- Real-time status: idle, working, error, done
- Push notifications when tasks complete
- Mobile-responsive design

**Tech Stack**

**Backend:** Rust + Axum, tokio async I/O, portable-pty
**Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript, Zustand, xterm.js
**Binary:** ~14MB, <100MB idle memory
**Tests:** 650+ Rust tests, 386+ frontend tests

**Current Status**

Phase 1 complete (6 months development + polish). Production-ready and stable.

Currently focusing on:
- Bug reports and fixes
- UX polish and performance
- Documentation improvements

**Looking For:**
- User feedback on autonomous workflows
- Bug reports from real-world usage
- Feature suggestions for Phase 2
- Contributors

**GitHub:** https://github.com/dario-valles/Ralph-UI

**Discussion**

Would love to hear:
- What's your autonomous AI workflow look like?
- What tools have you built for agent orchestration?
- Any creative agent setups I should learn from?

Roast my setup! Flex your tools! Let's share knowledge and make autonomous AI development better for everyone.

## Option 4: Discord/Slax Community Post

**Title:** 🚀 Just shipped Ralph UI - Autonomous AI agent orchestration

**Body:**

Hey everyone! 👋

After 6 months of late nights and weekends, I just shipped Ralph UI - a browser-based mission control for autonomous AI coding agents.

**The TL;DR:**
- Run 7 different AI agents autonomously for 14+ hours
- Transform chat conversations into production PRDs
- 67-90% token savings via session resumption
- Monitor from phone, tablet, anywhere
- Everything stored in git

**What I'm Most Proud Of:**

1. **Ralph Wiggum Loop** - Agents work continuously, using git as memory. When context fills, fresh agents spawn. Zero human intervention.

2. **Chat-to-PRD** - AI extracts requirements from conversations. Deep questioning, user stories, acceptance criteria. No more vague specs.

3. **Token Savings** - Session resumption is a game changer. 20-message conversations drop from 210 to just 20 exchanges.

4. **Git-Native** - Every session, PRD, chat committed to repo. Version control your AI workflow.

**Quick Demo:**
[Video link or GIF]

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Rust + Axum
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript
- Binary: 14MB

**Current Status:**
Phase 1 complete (polish + bugfix). Production-ready. Using it daily for client work.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/dario-valles/Ralph-UI

**Would love to:**
- Get feedback from other AI tool builders
- See what y'all have built
- Hear about your autonomous workflows
- Connect with fellow developers

**Questions for the community:**
- What's your longest autonomous agent session?
- Anyone else using git as agent memory?
